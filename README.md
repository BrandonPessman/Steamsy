# steamInspectorAPI

The API for the Steam Inspector Web Application. Currently, I am creating Version 3 for the API.

## Notes

Ideally, I would love to use a database, but don't really want to pay for one, so I am using memory and running calculations on the run, which isn't the most scalable solution. Ideally, I would love to store the comments for every game on steam and key information on everygame, but that isn't within the scope yet.
